            <h2>Why Te Waipounamu?</h2>
            <h3>The island is also known as Te Waka a Māui which means "Māui's Canoe"</h3>
            <p>Various Māori iwi sometimes use different names, with some preferring to call the South Island Te Waka o Aoraki, referring to another Māori legend called the story of Aoraki, as after the world was created, Aoraki and his three brothers came down in a waka to visit their mother, Papatūānuku the earth mother, only to crash after failing to perform a karakia on their way back home to their father, Ranginui (also known as Raki) the sky father, in turn causing the waka to transform into an island and the four brothers into the mountain ranges on top of it.</p>
            <p>Te Waipounamu, or the South Island of New Zealand, is renowned for its breathtaking natural beauty, including the Southern Alps, fjords, and pristine lakes. It is home to Aoraki / Mount Cook, the highest peak in New Zealand, and the Fiordland National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage site. The island offers diverse outdoor activities such as hiking, skiing, and wildlife watching. The South Island is also known for its vibrant cities like Christchurch and Queenstown, which serve as gateways to the island's natural wonders. The region's rich Maori culture and history add to its allure as a travel destination.</p>
